# Game Stability Fixes Summary

## Issue Fixed: Options Shuffling During Gameplay

**Problem:** Options in vocabulary games were shuffling/moving positions during gameplay, making the interface irritating and unstable.

**Root Cause:** The game components were shuffling options on every render instead of only when the question changes.

## Files Modified:

### 1. Word Match Game (`word-match-game.tsx`)
- **Before:** Options shuffled on every component render
- **After:** Options are shuffled only once per question and remain stable during that question
- **Changes:**
  - Added `currentOptions` state to store stable options
  - Added `useEffect` to generate options only when question changes
  - Updated component to use `currentOptions` instead of inline shuffling

### 2. Synonym Showdown Game (`synonym-showdown-game.tsx`)
- **Before:** Options shuffled on every component render
- **After:** Options are shuffled only once per question and remain stable during that question
- **Changes:**
  - Added `currentOptions` state to store stable options
  - Added `useEffect` to generate options only when question changes
  - Updated component to use `currentOptions` instead of inline shuffling

### 3. Math Challenge Game (`math-challenge-game.tsx`)
- **Status:** No changes needed - already stable
- **Reason:** Uses proper option generation within the problem generation function

## Benefits:
✅ **Stable Interface:** Options no longer move during gameplay
✅ **Better UX:** Players can confidently select answers without fear of options shifting
✅ **Reduced Frustration:** Eliminates the irritating behavior of shuffling options
✅ **Consistent Behavior:** All games now have stable option positioning

## Testing:
- Games now maintain option positions throughout each question
- Options only change when moving to the next question
- All existing functionality preserved
- Performance improved (less re-rendering)
